# FAQ accordion
### Frontend Mentor Challenge

The challenge was to build out this FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

Users should be able to:
* Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
* Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

#### Languages

* HTML
